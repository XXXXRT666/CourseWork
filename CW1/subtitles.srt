1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,800
Okay, recording is on.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello to future listeners.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,320
For posterity,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,760
the purpose of
this meeting is to

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,680
clarify the
specifications for

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,440
the entertainment
booking app,

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,640
which we at Acme
Corp are making for

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,800
the University
of Hindeburgh.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm Bobby from the
team at Acme Corp,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,720
and here with me,

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,320
we have... Hi, I'm Cristina.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,520
I work at the University
of Hindeburgh

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,560
as the Lead of the
Student Support Team.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,440
Also another colleague
of mine, Jessica,

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,840
from the Student
Wellbeing

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,640
Department, was supposed
to be here with me,

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,440
but she wasn't
able to make it.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,840
She left me some notes,

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,080
though, so hopefully
that would be enough.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,920
Let's hope it is.

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,080
Okay, let's talk
about the app.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,680
First off, can you give me

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,165
a rundown of its
basic functionality?

24
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,770
Certainly. The idea is

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,650
that various
entertainment providers,

26
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,610
which are businesses
like theatres,

27
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,010
cinemas, sports
places, and so on,

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,970
can register onto
the app and then

29
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,250
add their events
onto the app, too.

30
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,050
Then, students would also
be able to log in and

31
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,330
request a list of all of

32
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,410
the event performances
at a certain date,

33
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,450
choose specific
performances to

34
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,490
look at in more detail,

35
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,970
and book the performance

36
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,730
they're viewing
if they want to.

37
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,930
Okay, great. So let's

38
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,650
pick that apart
one by one.

39
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,850
You mentioned
entertainment providers

40
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,050
can register onto the app,

41
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,850
but in the written
spec we got,

42
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,530
you also mentioned
something about

43
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,130
verifying them by checking

44
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,170
a list. Can you elaborate?

45
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,850
Yes. We can't just

46
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,170
allow anyone with an
Internet connection to

47
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,850
say they're an
entertainment provider

48
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,890
offering events
to uni students.

49
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,850
There needs to be
some verification.

50
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,850
Makes sense. Okay.
But how do we do it?

51
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,570
Well, thankfully,

52
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,410
the university
already maintains an

53
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,930
up-to-date list
of approved

54
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,530
businesses for
other reasons,

55
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,090
so we could just use that.

56
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,810
We were intending to
just give you the list.

57
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,370
Okay. But how do

58
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,250
we then keep that
list updated?

59
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,730
Do you just send us

60
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,890
a new list every time

61
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,490
you make a change to it?

62
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,810
That could work, but it

63
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,930
wouldn't be
very efficient.

64
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,160
Hold on for a second.

65
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Oh, yes. Here it

66
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,440
is in my notes
from our techs.

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,800
There's apparently
an API you can use

68
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,640
to directly ask
our system if

69
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,680
a specific entertainment
provider's

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
business number
is on the list.

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,640
If it is, you allow
the registration.

72
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,040
If not, don't allow
the registration.

73
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,920
Okay. Yeah. So we just
use the API then.

74
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,640
Great. Okay, that
clears it up.

75
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,320
And then how
do you want to

76
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
do student registration?

77
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,180
Should there be a
similar system for that?

78
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,280
No, students would
be

79
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
pre-registered with their

80
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
university credentials,

81
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,720
and they would
just log in freely.

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
No need to check for them.

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
Okay. Understood.
Now, moving on

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,240
to the entertainment
provider

85
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,120
creating a new event
on the system.

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,600
I think for the most part,

87
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,280
we understand how
that should work,

88
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
except we weren't sure

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
about the way
tickets work.

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,675
In what way?

91
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:09,110
So when a student books
a ticket on the app,

92
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,550
we would need
to notify the

93
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,830
entertainment
provider about it

94
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,070
because that way they can

95
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,470
update their logs of
who has bought tickets,

96
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,670
and they can also update

97
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,990
their count of
remaining tickets.

98
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,810
Surely, they
need to do that.

99
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,750
Okay, so you
could do that?

100
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,830
We could, but there
are issues with it.

101
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,110
We need some kind
of integration

102
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,670
with every entertainment

103
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,830
provider's own
ticketing system,

104
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,910
and that's
problematic since

105
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,230
every one of their systems
will be different.

106
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,430
Alternatively,
we could come up

107
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,190
with some general
solution,

108
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,190
but then that
would likely be

109
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,270
very limiting in some
other ways, probably.

110
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Actually, you don't
need to do that.

111
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,440
Part of the deal with

112
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,240
the entertainment
providers would

113
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
be that they
reserve tickets

114
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,720
to use just on our system.

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,120
These are separate from

116
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,320
any other tickets they may

117
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,640
be selling themselves.

118
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,360
So they wouldn't
need to update

119
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,840
their remaining
ticket count

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,165
at all when someone
books on the app.

121
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,850
Okay. So just to

122
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,610
check if I understand
correctly,

123
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,730
the entertainment
provider just

124
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,090
specifies the number of

125
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,810
tickets for each
performance.

126
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,410
And after that, we just

127
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,770
handle it entirely
on our own system,

128
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,290
and we don't even have to

129
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,250
communicate with them
at all after that.

130
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,610
Yes. Exactly. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. That does

131
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,490
make things a lot
easier. Yeah.

132
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,050
I'm glad.

133
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,810
Okay. Now, next point.

134
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,730
When students request

135
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,290
the list of performances,

136
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,970
they specify a date

137
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,770
and get a list of
performances on that date.

138
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,410
What should students see

139
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,555
in that list of
performances?

140
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,540
Just some basic info,

141
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,700
like the event name,

142
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,460
the time and venue
of the performance,

143
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,860
who is the one providing

144
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,780
the event... I guess
that's enough.

145
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,020
Okay. And I assume
they should see

146
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,620
all available
info when they

147
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,540
look at a specific
performance.

148
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,020
Yes, indeed.

149
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,500
But this reminds me.

150
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,300
We talked about

151
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,020
an additional
feature we wanted

152
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,420
that I believe isn't in

153
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,100
the specification
we sent you.

154
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,860
Did we talk about students

155
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,100
being able to
choose preferences?

156
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,180
Preferences? No.
There wasn't

157
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,660
anything like
that in the spec.

158
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,985
Okay. What's the
idea with that?

159
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,030
The idea is that students

160
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,310
should be able to specify

161
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,550
preferences regarding
performances somehow.

162
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,830
And whenever they get

163
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,270
the list of performances,

164
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,030
it will prioritise ones

165
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,110
that match their
preferences.

166
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,710
Okay. Yeah, that

167
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,190
sounds like a
very good idea.

168
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,550
Okay. How would

169
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,390
they specify their
preferences,

170
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,070
and how would

171
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,870
the prioritisation
work exactly?

172
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,570
Well, to be honest,
I'm not sure.

173
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,570
It was a spur-of-the-moment idea 
Jessica had,

174
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,370
but she's not
here, so... Okay.

175
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,530
Do we then organise
a meeting at

176
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,090
some later date
with Jessica

177
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,810
so we can talk
about the details?

178
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,090
Unfortunately,
Jessica won't be

179
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,450
back any time soon,

180
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,890
so I don't think
that's an option.

181
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,290
And anyways, for
things like this,

182
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,690
we're happy for you to go

183
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,410
with what students
would like.

184
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,250
Maybe ask them how
they feel about

185
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,410
it and implement it
based on what they want.

186
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,820
Okay. Yeah, we'll do that.

187
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,860
Yeah, we were
actually planning

188
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,620
to organise
something like that...

189
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,180
Sorry to interrupt!

190
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,780
I must shortly run
to another meeting,

191
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,300
and there's more
we need to cover.

192
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Did you have any other
questions on your end?

193
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,300
Sure. We have one
more question.

194
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,340
Regarding booking,
how do we handle when

195
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,940
students book
performances for

196
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,100
non-ticketed events? How
does that even work?

197
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,780
Well, they should
only be able to

198
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,340
book ones for
ticketed events.

199
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,620
The non-ticketed ones

200
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,980
shouldn't require or
even allow bookings.

201
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,060
Okay. Got you. Right.

202
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,460
That's everything
on our end.

203
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,940
Was there anything
else you wanted

204
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,865
to talk about that
we haven't covered?

205
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,150
Yes. Jessica was really

206
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,350
insistent that we include

207
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,510
a review system
for the events so

208
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,230
students know how much
they were enjoyed.

209
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,790
Okay. That sounds
reasonable as well.

210
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,310
Did Jessica say how she
expects it to work,

211
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,070
or did she leave
anything in the notes?

212
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,260
Not really. It just
says "Reviews!!!" with

213
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,820
three exclammation
marks and with

214
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,980
a little arrow pointing to

215
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,900
it saying "Keep it simple".

216
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,740
I guess you could just
ask students to give

217
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,180
a review for
the performance

218
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,580
after the
performance happens?

219
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,940
A review for the performance
or for the event

220
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,740
overall? Because
the performance

221
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,420
will have ended by then...

222
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,460
Oh, yes, you're right.

223
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,020
Maybe for the event

224
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,340
overall makes more
sense in that case...

225
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,460
But what if an event has

226
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,900
performances with
different performers,

227
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,620
some better than others?

228
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,020
How would students
distinguish ratings in

229
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,590
this case? I don't know...

230
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,150
Yeah. That's a
good question.

231
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,870
There might be
some simple way

232
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,630
to do it, though.

233
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,750
If you want, we
could try to do

234
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,510
some research
regarding that

235
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,010
with the students, if
that's okay with you.

236
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,110
Sorry. Oh, sure.
Yes, let's say that.

237
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,870
Implement review somehow,
but keep it simple:

238
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,350
a rating and a comment, and

239
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,030
students seeing the
average rating somewhere.

240
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,070
Okay. Yeah, we'll
look into that. Yeah.

241
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,390
I'm really sorry, but

242
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,630
I really need to go now.

243
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,350
I hope this
meeting was useful

244
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,150
and helped you understand

245
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,350
what we want from the app!

246
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,750
Yeah, it definitely did.

247
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,630
Thanks for your
time, Cristina.

248
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,430
Thank you! Okay, bye!

249
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:47,770
Bye! Okay. Who even

250
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,970
thinks it's a good idea to

251
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,170
schedule a ten-minute
meeting for this?

252
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,610
It's way not enough.
Oh, whoops!
