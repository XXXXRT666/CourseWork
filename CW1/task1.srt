1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
see so you just kept up to date and let me get my questions and are you guys ready?

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:29,840
okay start

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:37,760
so for the students review part is the rating could be like one to five star or simple like or dislike

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,080
so when a performance that i have booked has passed or i've attended as well i'd like to be able to

5
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,440
leave a review for it this should include a compulsory one to five rating and an optional

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,080
free text field this should become a review for its event which also mentions that performance

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:04,560
that i have attended as well okay yeah now our second option is for tickets that are fully sponsored

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:13,920
for free is it still necessary to call an external payment interface or can the reverse reservation

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
number be issued directly by the app

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,080
so are you talking about when it's fully covered from the sponsor yeah so as a student i don't know

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,960
the answer uh but they should probably get an automatic reference that's a good idea yeah

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,800
okay okay okay i have my own personal preference

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,600
can the can the ep just give an address of performance like a pending a pending status like

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
they're going to give a specific address but we will give it like before the performance

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,320
did you repeat that question yeah can the ep provide the address as pending

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,480
and they can modify the address before the performance like one day before just give the actual address

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:05,440
so i can't answer that as a student because that's the ep's job but i would say that's a good idea yes

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:15,760
yes okay and what's the um can the entertainment provider see the uh all the contact details of the

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,280
audience or just can see the email address or and their name so once again i can't answer that but my

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,880
preference would be um if the user gives consent to other information about them then yes but i would say

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:40,960
only be email and their name do you want to have a preference feature like uh like the event provider

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,640
should be required to tag performance with a certain amount of relevant keywords from a

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,720
predetermined list so students could be then select them select like which tags they are interested in

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,400
and the system would display events in order to match the tags so yeah so for that performance

25
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,200
you'd have a preference for that performance right yeah and that would be up to three event types such

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,200
as music movie or sports and you can also choose no preferences at all when you're searching up so

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
that would probably yes that would be a tagging feature that they would implement

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:48,560
so when you're reviewing when you're viewing the reviews is that what was that your question yeah

29
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,760
when requesting a list of performances for each one i'd like to see the average rating from all the reviews

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,800
for that specific event uh then when i look at a specific performance in addition to all the usual

31
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,040
information i'd see i should also be able to see the both the average rating and that individual review

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,880
as well with performance that it was about the review rating and that optional comment field as well

33
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,680
yeah and another question can subsidy be increased or decreased can what be subsidy or subsidy and i guess

34
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:33,440
sponsor sponsor um so that's as a student i don't know the answer but i would say probably yeah

35
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:45,520
yeah but i can't give a specific answer to that unfortunately

36
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,280
what specific details do you want students to see when looking at the specific performance

37
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:03,760
uh that has so at that performance that's already happened or that you're trying to go to you're trying to go to

38
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,000
okay

39
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,240
um i want to ask about the details that you can edit when there's no booking can you edit the price

40
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:30,560
so um so as a student i don't know the answer to that but the ep should be able to change the time

41
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,040
and the booking date as well but i don't know the specifics on the other side

42
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,600
okay thank you very much thank you no problem
